<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   So you got picked for a grand jury. Don&#8217;t fret. It&#8217;s not a disaster. Grand jury duty
was one of the most tense, stressful, rewarding, and empowering civic experiences of
my life. It&#8217;s a rare opportunity for ordinary citizens to exercise real power to change
the world for the better, particularly if you are inclined towards progressive
politics. But to avoid two weeks of slogging through lawyers reading legal
documents at you just so you can vote unanimously and unquestioningly with
your other jurors, you need to know <em>how</em> to apply your power as a grand
juror. And trust me, nobody at the courthouse is going to fill you in on
this.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   What the heck is a grand jury anyway? What it&#8217;s <em>not</em> is a trial. There won&#8217;t be
lawyers from opposing sides dueling it out, trying to win you over with with
charismatic showmanship while dropping shocking revelations about the other
side. To get to a trial like that, first the government needs to file formal
charges against a person accused of a crime. And that is done by convincing a
grand jury there is enough evidence to charge the person with a crime. The
grand jury bit is required by the Constitution. The idea is that accused
people aren&#8217;t charged with a crime by the <em>government</em>, they are charged
by the <em>people</em>, the people in this case being you: the grand jury. What the
Constitution doesn&#8217;t require is for accused people or their lawyers to be in the
room.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   The person accused of a crime has no chance to defend herself to a grand jury
(except in the rare cases where they can choose to testify &#8212; but they still don&#8217;t get a
lawyer to help them). The only people presenting a case to the grand jury is the
government&#8217;s lawyers &#8212; usually Assistant District Attorneys (ADAs) &#8212; who present
only evidence in favor of charging the accused. The formal charge against the
accused is called an indictment. All of this stuff will be explained to you at
the courthouse, but it&#8217;s important to know from the start what you&#8217;re in
                                                                  

                                                                  
for.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   What won&#8217;t be explained to you is that the government fully expects you to
indict &#8211; every time and preferably quickly. The vast majority of grand jury cases are
indicted. Before you just vote for indictment, you need to know that you have a small
but very real power over the government in a grand jury. You can use this power to
make the government work harder for its indictments, and in doing so you can
add a little more real justice to a system that is more just in letter than in
practice.
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>It&#8217;s you versus the Assistant District Attorneys</h3>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >You will be reminded over and over again that you are not deciding innocence or
guilt, you are only deciding whether to charge someone with a crime. You will be
repeatedly informed that the guilt or innocence of the accused will be determined by
a trial jury, not you. The formal process, and your responsibilities as a juror will be
beat into you. But other concepts will be glossed over, or left out entirely. You are
being managed like cattle. The ADAs deal with thousands of jurors every week. They
have lots of practice getting jurors to do what they want: hand out indictments. To
make the grand jury process efficient, the professionals who run it actively <em>avoid</em>
tipping you off to the larger context of the system you are participating
in.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   This is how the process will work: the ADA presents a small slice of the evidence
against the accused to you, the grand jury. Most of the time this doesn&#8217;t take very
long, a case might be presented to the grand jury in a single 20 minute presentation.
The ADA is the only person presenting this to you, there is no judge in
the room. Since the ADA&#8217;s job is to get an indictment they only show you
evidence that is convincing. (And legal &#8212; if a judge reviews the case later and
determines the ADA presented something illegally, the whole case can be
thrown out.) The grand jury is then left alone to decide if the ADA presented
enough evidence to bring charges against the accused. If you decide to indict
the person on charges, the person has the <em>right</em> to take the case to a trial
jury.
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   But that process is based on the idea that justice will be served in a trial jury. In
reality, the person charged is almost certainly going to plead guilty to some or all of
the crimes you charged him with, in exchange for less punishment. 90-95% of cases
are settled by plea bargaining.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-1" id="enmark-1">1</a></sup> The accused is forced to &#8220;bargain&#8221; with the
government&#8217;s lawyers, who have the upper hand because you gave them a
formal charge. The vast majority of cases do <em>not</em> end with the big dramatic
trial that is the cornerstone of courtroom drama television. The grand jury
hearing is the <em>only</em> trial most people will ever get, and they aren&#8217;t even in the
room.
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Since <em>nobody</em> is arguing for the accused, the only justice available to them is
through the grand jury, which put you in direct opposition to the ADA. You are the
skeptical observer for the people keeping the government&#8217;s power in check. The
                                                                  

                                                                  
ADA&#8217;s job is to convince you that there is a good reason to charge the defendant. It&#8217;s
you versus the ADA. Your mission as someone interested in justice is to make the
ADA&#8217;s job really hard.
</p><!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>The ADA is not your friend</h3>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Some ADAs are funny and charismatic. Some are hard calculating professionals.
Some are attractive and have a smile that melts your tender heart. And some
are more or less incompetent. None of them are your friend. Don&#8217;t fall for
the trap of trying to please the ADA. You might be spending a lot of time
watching this ADA. They seem friendly and trustworthy. The ADAs do
their best to make it appear that they know all the evidence, rules, and
procedures, and your job is simply to follow instructions, and give them their
indictment. You will hear them repeatedly say, &#8220;as your legal counselor&#8221; as if the
purpose is to remind you they are the only person in the room with a law
degree. This does not mean they have your best interest in mind, or that
fairness is their goal. This just means they can legally only tell you certain
things.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   You will likely start to feel like you want to make this professional, good-looking,
charismatic lawyer happy, so he will get drinks with you later or something. Don&#8217;t
fall for that. They don&#8217;t care about you. They aren&#8217;t going to even remember who
you are. There&#8217;s 23 of you so they probably don&#8217;t even see any of you as individuals.
Which is good because it gives you a little anonymity you can hide behind. No
matter how aggressive an ADA might seem, they can&#8217;t really do anything to you.
Their job is to get indictments out of the grand jury. Your job is to only give them
indictments they have earned by proving that the indictment is fair and
just.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>The ADA <em>will</em> lie to you</h3>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Over and over again the ADA will say, &#8220;remember it is not my recollection that
controls, but your recollection. Having said that, <em>my</em> recollection is that&hellip;&#8221; This is his
immunity card, after saying that phrase, he is legally allowed to tell you whatever he
wants &#8212; because it&#8217;s just his &#8220;recollection&#8221;, get it? He will tell you whatever it is he
<em>wanted</em> you to hear from the evidence presented, whether it was actually included or
not.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   It is easy to catch them at this, they will do it on nearly every single case,
particularly if you ask them many questions about the evidence. Right before they
leave you for deliberations, they will ask if you have any last questions. This is your
chance both to review the evidence, and get them to tell you what story they were
                                                                  

                                                                  
<em>hoping</em> the evidence would suggest. Ask them to recap the evidence and testimony
you heard. In many cases, the story they want you to hear won&#8217;t line up with the
evidence as actually presented. If you manage to trip them up like this, often the
truth will rise to the surface, and make your deliberations much easier. When
you suspect the ADA lied to you, don&#8217;t doubt yourself, <em>your</em> recollection
probably is correct, as the immunity phrase says. During deliberations ask
your other jurors what they remember, if most of you agree, then what
you collectively remember probably is the truth, not what the ADA told
you.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Take tons of notes</h3>
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >On your first day you will see a video in which a judge says, &#8220;taking notes is neither
encouraged nor forbidden&#8221; and you might think &#8220;great! I&#8217;m off the hook for
note-taking!&#8221; Ignore that. Take as many notes as you can. Write down <em>everything</em>
because, as explained above, you can&#8217;t trust the ADA. To make things even more
confusing, most of the evidence is going to be presented to you in 15-20
minute segments which is mixed with possibly dozens of cases you will hear
over your time on the grand jury. (I&#8217;m not going to say they do this on
purpose &#8212; that would be just a little too conspiratorial.) It is very difficult to
keep track of everything, so develop a good note-taking system that will let
you put all your notes together for a given case quickly. It can be tough
to do because, on top of the cases being presented to you in many short
increments over a number of days, you are required to use the court&#8217;s little
blue essay books for notes. (They shred the books at the end of your jury
duty.)
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   You&#8217;ll usually get a little advance warning about which case you are about to hear
evidence for when the ADA walks into the room. There will be a different ADA for
each case, most of the time. So you can start to associate a specific case with an
ADA, and when that ADA comes in, start reviewing your notes. If you can&#8217;t
remember the details of a case, ask your fellow jurors during the inevitable
paper-shuffling minutes before the lawyer starts talking. But the ADA isn&#8217;t going to
want to let you talk to your other jurors at this point, so you have to sneak it in
quickly. The ADA will officially review what you&#8217;ve heard already if you ask them
too, but remember your fellow jurors will be more accurate than what the ADA tells
you.
</p><!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   Most evidence is going to be testimony from witnesses or police officers. Write
down absolutely everything they say. Some evidence, like lab reports, will
be printed on paper. You don&#8217;t have to write down everything read off of
papers, but make sure to ask the ADA to leave those papers with you for your
deliberations. Make sure you ask the ADA to <em>leave</em> the papers. Otherwise they might
just hold them up for you to see. You have the right to have the evidence
in front of you during deliberations, but many ADAs don&#8217;t want to give
                                                                  

                                                                  
you the opportunity to review the evidence too closely if they can avoid
it.
</p><!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   During your orientation they will tell you that you can get the court reporter to
read back parts of the testimony, which is another thing that might lead you
to think you can slack off on taking notes. It sounds cool, right? Just like
courtroom dramas on television. While this is technically possible, they
normally won&#8217;t do it unless you take a vote in your deliberations and 12
jurors would like to hear a read-back. This almost never happens, which
means you will never get to hear the testimony a second time. The evidence
before you is only your notes, your recollection, and the occasional lab report.

</p><!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Don&#8217;t feel like you have to do what the law says</h3>
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >You will be instructed over and over that you have to apply the law without
sympathy and whether you agree with the law or not. This is simply not
true. Grand juries have <em>unqualified</em> power to decline to indict.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-3" id="enmark-3">3</a></sup> That is why
grand jury deliberations are entirely secret. It is a moral question, up to you,
whether you <em>want</em> to apply the law as it stands, or not. There are good reasons
not to indict even if the law and the evidence is clear. Does the accused
remind you of your own drug dealer, and you just don&#8217;t feel it is right for
them to be charged with a crime for have a pound of marijuana in their
trunk? Dismiss! Do you believe the system unfairly persecutes people of color?
Dismiss anyone who isn&#8217;t white! Go ahead. Really. You&#8217;re allowed to! Are
you an anarchist who believes the government has no authority? Dismiss
them all! (Good luck convincing your fellow jurors to go along with you
though.)
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t let instructions from the ADA make you think you have to indict because
of the law. The charges and instructions to the grand jury are very <em>very</em> carefully
worded to make it seem like you have to indict if the law was broken. But if
you pay close attention, you will notice that the instructions are worded to
tell you that you <em>do not</em> have to do what the law says. They will tell you
that you &#8220;may&#8221; indict someone if there is substantial legal evidence and
reasonable cause to believe they did it, but you &#8220;must&#8221; dismiss them if those two
things are not true. Just remember that you <em>always</em> have the right to not
indict.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Think of it this way: you are doing them a favor if you find to dismiss &#8212; it
probably means their evidence was weak, the law was a really stupid law, or the ADA
presents himself as an asshole that juries don&#8217;t like. If any of those things are true,
and the case went to trial, it is likely the trial jury would dismiss the case anyway. So
you are saving that ADAs the trouble of potentially going to a long expensive trial
that they would just lose. Your discretion will make for better cases. Or you might be
saving people guilty of relatively minor offenses from being forced to plea
                                                                  

                                                                  
bargain.
</p><!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Ask questions of the ADA</h3>
<!--l. 187--><p class="noindent" >Constantly ask the ADA questions. Remember, they are trying to obfuscate any facts
that might make you doubt your decision to indict. It&#8217;s you versus the ADA. If they
give you an answer you don&#8217;t understand, ask another question. When it comes time
to deliberate, the ADA will first give you a list of definitions of concepts that are
relevant to the charges they are presenting. These are often counter-intuitive, like the
fact that an &#8220;armed handgun&#8221; includes weapons that are empty, but were
found sitting next to ammo that could be used with them. Sometimes they
include definitions that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> really relevant to the charges, or maybe they are
relevant to one charge but the ADA tries to make it seem like they apply to all
charges.
</p><!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >   The charges are the most complicated part. All of the definitions and charges
are read to you in twisted legalese. Ask the ADA to read the definitions
repeatedly until you understand what they are saying, and make sure you know
which charges the definitions apply to. First you will get the name of the
charge, and then the requirements the evidence has to meet for the accused to
be charged with that crime. The hard part is that there might be a long
list of charges and the difference between charges might be just a word or
two.
</p><!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Like Burglary In The 2nd Degree might be defined as &#8220;stole something off a
person&#8221;, while Burglary In The 3rd Degree is just &#8220;stole something&#8221;. And there&#8217;s
some (frankly insane) law that prevents them from giving you a written copy of the
charges. So ask the ADA to read them. And then ask the ADA to read them again.
Ask the ADA to explain the difference between charges that are similar.
(Some ADAs will try to explain them in plain language, others will just
read the legalese version again.) Just keep asking until everyone on the jury
understands.
</p><!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >   Up until the moment when they give you the charges, you don&#8217;t know which
evidence you heard was relevant to what charge they are going to give. Now that you
know the charge, ask the ADA to clarify evidence you head that you need to make a
decision. But don&#8217;t forget that the ADA <em>will</em> lie to you and tell you only the things
they &#8220;recollect&#8221;. Consult your notes and see if you think they ADA is being accurate
at this point.
</p><!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Form a coalition</h3>
<!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >There are 23 people on a grand jury. At least 12 jurors have to vote for indictment to
                                                                  

                                                                  
file the charges. That means a lot of people can vote to dismiss the charges (or not
even be there) and charges could still be filed. It isn&#8217;t like Twelve Angry Men where
you need a unanimous vote and one person with an opposing view has the power to
hold everything up. On a grand jury, most of the time even if you vote for
dismissing charges, you&#8217;ll just be in the minority and charges will be filed
anyway.
</p><!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   Because of this, you want to form a coalition of like-minded jurors. This
makes the down-time between cases (of which there will probably be a lot)
very important. It&#8217;s your chance to talk to your fellow jurors and find out
what their interests are in general, and more importantly what their values
might be as jurors. Even if you find only a few people share your values,
standing together during deliberations will give you a much better chance of
swaying twelve or more people to your position than if it&#8217;s just you standing
alone.
</p><!--l. 226--><p class="indent" >   My jury had a large minority that was interested in reducing the number of
people who end up involved with the criminal justice system for relatively minor
offenses. We were able to repeatedly convince the larger portion of the jury to dismiss
charges for small amounts of drugs and for criminal charges that stemmed from
simply having friends engaged in illegal activities or being in the wrong place at the
wrong time. We weren&#8217;t successful on every case &#8212; 23 people randomly selected in
NYC will inevitably yield a diverse range of political views &#8212; but enough times that
I came out of jury duty with a strong sense of having made a difference in the
world.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Come to a decision</h3>
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >Do your best, as a jury, to reach a decision on every charge presented to you, whether
for or against. This is important because if you reach a decision the ADA no longer
has any power over you. But if you can&#8217;t reach a decision, the ADA has the
power to badger you, aggressively reading the instructions again to try to
make you feel like you aren&#8217;t doing your civic duty, or sending you back into
deliberations. There&#8217;s a limit to how much they can do this because a judge will
review the record later and could decide the ADA was badgering the jury
too much, but it is not fun to have a professional lawyer using all of their
persuasive powers to try to bully you into reaching a decision. If you can reach a
decision, indict or dismiss, the ADA can&#8217;t say anything further to you. If
the ADA disagrees with your decision (which would be a dismissal since
their job is to get indictments) all they can do is shake their heads and walk
away.
</p><!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Ask for more evidence</h3>
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >If you seriously can&#8217;t come to a decision, the ADA will likely act annoyed. In addition
to badgering you, they will eventually ask if more evidence might help you reach a
decision. Unless the problem is a moral split on your jury, it&#8217;s a good idea to
say yes. On my jury there were multiple cases where we could not reach a
decision because of the weak evidence presented. The ADAs came back a
few days later with stronger evidence, and we were able to reach a decision
without nearly as much difficulty. These are usually cases where the ADAs
had simply been too lazy to gather all the evidence they should have the
first time. One of your jobs is to hold ADAs to a very high professional
standard.
</p><!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Go forth and spread justice</h3>
<!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s a good idea to go into jury duty believing in the power of the written word of the
law. Like many other parts of the legal system, the grand jury process includes a vast
difference between a person&#8217;s rights under the law, and the day-to-day conventions of
how people are processed by the legal system. This goes for both you as a juror
and for the person accused of a crime. Make your decisions based on what
the law <em>says</em> and what you feel is just, not the instructions the ADA gives
you.
</p><!--l. 254--><p class="indent" >   This isn&#8217;t to say a little cynicism isn&#8217;t appropriate. Toward the end of my jury
service, a young fellow juror said, &#8221;The thing I learned from grand jury duty is that
the law can really be bent to mean anything.&#8221; But knowing your rights and power as
a grand juror can help keep the system focussed on the rights of the accused rather
than the conventions of prosecution.
