I ditched the texfiles directory, and compiled without the css config file.
I want to post this on tumblr now, so I'm trying to keep the html as simple as possible. 

So this is compiled with:
htlatex ./MusicforEmma.tex "marks-htlatex-plain-html.cfg,-css,NoFonts"

the -css makes htlatex not use css (particularly span tags)
The marks-htlatex-plain.cfg file just contains a couple of handlers for \textit \textbr and \emph which would otherwise have to handled with css. 
basically all that is needed to get pretty simple html output out of htlatex.
The outputted .html file is then dumped onto tumblr.
